Ongoing portfolio of software developed for my master's thesis using data science techniques.

Date of presentation of the thesis: June 2020.

Supervised database of League of Legends professional players' statistics for season 9:

    - Supervisor: win percentage.
    
    - Features: standardized per-game performance statistics, such as KDA, farm/gold differential at fifteen minutes, vision control scores and damage percentage.

Find also in this directory an earlier project made by me for the course "Advanced Topics in Data Science", on Predicting Win Rates in Professional e-Sports via Supervised Learning (LASSO, Random Forests and Bayesian Model Averaging), in PDF format.
